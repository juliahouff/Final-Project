					<h2>The Cons of Having Urban Chickens</h1>
					<p> 
						Chickens will use up a lot of your resources, including your money and your time. You have to buy a coop, which can cost upward of a few hundred dollars. Chicken feed is also an ongoing cost, which will put you down around $30 a month depending on how many chickens you keep. You also have to buy a drinker and a feeder, and you are recommended to purchase multiple chickens because they are social animals that have a better quality of life when living with a flock. They also need a big back yard with lots of space.<br>
						<br>
						As far as taking up your time, you need to tend to them every day, clean out their cages frequently, and you will never be able to go on vacation because caring for chickens is a big commitment. They also live long past their egg-laying days with a lifespan of 10-12 years. Trying to get rid of a 3 year old chicken because she can no longer lay for you is very frowned upon in the chicken-keeping community, so you need to be able to commit 10 years of your life to each chicken you raise, just like you would any other pet.<br>
						<br>
						Chickens are also very gross sometimes and are not for the faint of heart. They smell very, very bad because they sleep where they poop, and cleaning that muck every other day is a real chore. If you slack on the cleaning, their poop and feathers will fall into small crevices where maggot infestations will occur during the summer, which can be detrimental. They are also prone to getting worms and lice if they are not well taken care of already, so you need to be sure that you can keep up with their needs to ensure a high quality of life.<br>
						<br>
						The last con is that everybody will want to have a bite of your new pet. Racoons and foxes would love to eat your chickens, and the only way you can protect your hens is to buy a heavy-duty wire that is welded on a grid, because racoons can tear through chicken wire like itâ€™s a paper bag. Foxes can also jump over wire, so you need to cover the top of their outdoor area as well. The pets you already own could be harmful as well. Dogs, depending on their temperament, can hunt your chickens or be too rough with them. There is also no way to keep your dog from its predatory instincts, so you should think twice before letting it near the coop.<br>
						<br>
						Cats have the potential to be bad as well, as they are evenly matched to chickens and they could end up tearing each other apart if a fight ensued. Cats will mainly be a threat to little chicks, so if you plan on having those, you also need to plan on keeping your cat indoors.<br>
