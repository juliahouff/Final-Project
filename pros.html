					<h2>The Pro's of Having Urban Chickens</h1>
					<p> 
						The first pro is that they will give you fresh eggs daily for three years straight. You will know that they are ethically sourced because you did it yourself, you know what went into the chickens, and they won’t have their hormones messed with. From this, you will get the satisfaction of collecting your own food. <br>
						<br>
						Chickens are also eco-friendly. You no longer have to buy Styrofoam egg cartons, and chickens can eat your scraps as long as they fit under a healthy diet—which for them is not very limited. They also produce rich manure, and you can compost all of their waste and use it in your garden. They also eat the bugs, slugs, and snails out of your lawn, so you won’t have to use pesticides or anything potentially harmful to plants to kill bugs on your plants. <br>
						<br>
						Chickens also have many benefits for your family life. They are great pets with unique personalities and quirks you will not see in other domesticated animals. They make great companions and become very affectionate if you take good care of them and spend lots of time with them, which you will definitely want to do. They can also be used to teach kids about responsibility and empathy for animals. They can also teach young kids how to count if they collect their eggs, colors because of their unique color palettes, and the life cycle. Caring for chickens also requires teamwork, and it will bring your family closer together.<br>
						<br>
						Raising chickens helps create self-sufficiency. Taking care of chickens will help you and your family to depend more on yourselves rather than on big corporations. People nowadays are looking for a way into more of a living-off-the-land kind of lifestyle, and raising chickens is a perfect introductory step to see if that lifestyle is for you. Anti-consumerism is also becoming more popular and raising chickens will help combat purchasing from chain grocery stores and create an appreciation for local fresh markets.<br>
						<br>
						You will also be given incentive to start growing other foods. The manure they make can help grow the healthiest crop possible. Since you are already collecting eggs, why not use your chicken poop to grow more food that you can collect yourself? Growing vegetables is cheaper than buying them at the store, and you will have much more satisfaction and fun when you get to eat or cook with them—just like you feel taking care of your chickens!<br>
