					<h2>How to Take Care of Chicks in Your Backyard</h1>
					<p> 
						<h3>Brooding Boxes</h3>
						Roosts are simply the place where the birds congregate to sleep at night. They will all generally sleep on the same perch (roost), although some do prefer to be by themselves if they feel perfectly safe.
						As far as taking up your time, you need to tend to them every day, clean out their cages frequently, and you will never be able to go on vacation because caring for chickens is a big commitment. They also live long past their egg-laying days with a lifespan of 10-12 years. Trying to get rid of a 3 year old chicken because she can no longer lay for you is very frowned upon in the chicken-keeping community, so you need to be able to commit 10 years of your life to each chicken you raise, just like you would any other pet.<br>

						<br>
						<h3>Bedding</h3>
						Something soft like pine shavings would be good. These are sold in small bales at most farm stores and they are inexpensive.
						If your brooder box has a slick floor (like plastic), lay some paper towels under the bedding so they can grip and stand properly otherwise they may develop problems with standing and walking.
						<br>
						<h3>Warmth</h3>
						Chicks require warmth – lots of it. They do not have true feathers until they are around 6-7 weeks old so cannot regulate their own temperature, so you must help them. You can use a heat lamp or ‘Electric hen’ heat plate.
						They will need to be warmed for around 6-7 weeks or until the ambient temperature is roughly the same as the brooder.
						During the first week the temperature at chick level will need to be 95F. This will reduce by 5 degrees each week until ambient temperature is reached. How do you know if they are warm enough?
						If they are all huddled in a bunch they are too cold; if they are spread to the edges of the brooder they are too hot; if they are dotted all over they are just right. A thermometer will help you with this too, but base your judgment on the chicks’ behavior.
						<br>
						<h3>Food</h3>
						0-8 weeks: 18-20% starter feed crumbles.<br>
						8-14 weeks: 16-18% starter/grower.<br>
						15-18 weeks: 16% finisher.<br>
						18 weeks upward: 16% layer feed.<br>
						Chick feed can come as medicated or un-medicated.
						The medicated feed is medicated with a coccidiostat which helps to protect them from coccidiosis – a terrible disease.
						If your chicks have been vaccinated at source for coccidia, then do not use medicated feed.
						Chicks are messy; they will scratch their food all over the place, poop in it and get their bedding in it, so you need a feeder that will eliminate some of that mess.
